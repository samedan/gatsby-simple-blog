# Summary

In this RFC, we propose introducing _Hooks_ to React.

- Hooks let you **reuse logic between components** without changing your component hierarchy.
- Hooks let you **split one component into smaller functions** based on what pieces are related.
- Hooks let you **use React without classes**.

Hooks are opt-in and **100% backwards-compatible**. You can use Hooks side by side with your existing code.

_This RFC is very detailed and inconvenient to read as a single Markdown file. Instead of condensing it and sacrificing important details, we decided to write our proposal in the form of documentation, and link to individual pages below. You can consider this documentation to be a part of the RFC, so please feel free to quote and discuss any content from it when commenting on the RFC._
